# Garbage_Tracking_System
The “Garbage Tracking System” is a Web Application, which is beneficial for the public to manage trash and live a thriving life. We, as common men, have been facing the problem of not 
knowing when the garbage collector will arrive. This web-based system helps the users to create 
their accounts and get to know when the garbage collector comes and they can also track the 
waste-collecting vehicle. The main objective of working on this project is to make people know 
about garbage carriers’ time. The whole community is supposed to be benefited from this web 
application. Moreover, the application is so user-friendly that any person can use it without any 
hindrance, irrespective of their educational qualifications.
